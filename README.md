Various Sway configurations I have added to my machine.

~ Tired of manually taking Screenshots from cli via grimshot? We can add binding to your config: use super+shift+a w s to capture (a) selected area (w) active window & (s) screen
~ Follow [instructions](https://github.com/Vtekickedinyo/sway.config/blob/main/sway.config) for sway config for screenshot keybinds.

~ Want to skip manually opening your config file?  Use foot as terminal + nano as editor?
~ This is a shortcut that gracefully closes the window when you close the editor.
~ Download & mv swayconf.desktop into ~/.local/share/applications/
~ Download & sudo mv for sway_logo.jxl into /usr/share/icons/
