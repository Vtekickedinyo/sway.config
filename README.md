### Various ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swaywm/sway/refs/heads/master/assets/Sway_Logo%2BText_Ver3.png) configurations added to my machine.
Sway+waybar+rofi+autotiling+slurp+grimshot+foot+nano 🖥️

## Tired of manually taking screen shots from cli via grimshot? 
Add bindings to your sway config: use super+shift+a w s to capture (a) selected area (w) active window & (s) screen
 follow [instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vtekickedinyo/sway.config/refs/heads/main/sway.config) on sway config for screenshot keybinds. 🖼️

## Want to skip manually opening your config file? 
 This shortcut is opened via super-d named sway config that gracefully closes the window when you close the editor. On this config 'super-d sway' brings up the shortcut. 🗔
 ### Download & mv [swayconf.desktop](https://github.com/Vtekickedinyo/sway.config/raw/refs/heads/main/swayconf.desktop) into 
```
~/.local/share/applications/
```
### Download & mv [sway_logo.jxl](https://github.com/Vtekickedinyo/sway.config/raw/refs/heads/main/sway_logo.jxl) into
 ```
~/.local/share/icons/
```
## Want that Old-Win ctrl+alt+Escape shortcut to open taskman? 
but btop in this case. Add in sway config Keybindings 🪟💨
 ###   
 ```
# Start btop
    bindsym ctrl+alt+Escape exec foot btop
```
