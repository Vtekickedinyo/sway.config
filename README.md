Various Sway configurations I have added to my machine.
Sway+waybar+rofi+autotiling+grimshot+slurp

## Tired of manually taking Screenshots from cli via grimshot? 
Add bindings to your config: use super+shift+a w s to capture (a) selected area (w) active window & (s) screen
 follow [instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vtekickedinyo/sway.config/refs/heads/main/sway.config) on sway config for screenshot keybinds.

## Want to skip manually opening your config file?  Use foot as terminal + nano as editor?
 This shortcut is opened via drun (This machine uses rofi) named sway config that gracefully closes the window when you close the editor.
