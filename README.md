## Tired of manually taking screen shots from cli via grimshot? 
Add bindings to your sway config: use super+shift+a w s to capture (a) selected area (w) active window & (s) screen
 follow [instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vtekickedinyo/sway.config/refs/heads/main/sway.config) on sway config for screenshot keybinds.

### Do you use foot as terminal + nano as editor?
 This shortcut is opened via drun named sway config that gracefully closes the window when you close the editor.
